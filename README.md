### 👋 Hi, I'm Oliver (Brxzee)

Early-career Software, Cloud, and Data Engineer with strong Python and .NET experience.

I build real systems — from event-driven services and automation clients to cloud infrastructure and data pipelines.
My background spans backend development, AWS platforms, infrastructure-as-code, and production engineering practices.

💼 Currently seeking roles in:
- Software Engineering (C#, Python)
- Cloud / Platform Engineering (AWS, Terraform)
- Data Engineering / Analytics
- Security Operations

🛠 Core Skills
- Languages: Python, C#, SQL
- Cloud: AWS (Lambda, S3, Kinesis, RDS, IAM, CloudWatch)
- Infrastructure: Terraform, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Systems: REST APIs, Event-Driven Architecture, ETL Pipelines
- Practices: Unit Testing, TDD, Git, Agile, Secure Coding

📌 Highlighted Projects
- **[Guardian Streamer](https://github.com/Brxzee/guardian-streamer)** – Event-driven AWS service ingesting API data and publishing real-time streams
- **[Cloud ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/Brxzee/royal-blue)** – Production-style data platform using Python, AWS, SQL, and Terraform
- **Real-Time Automation Client** – Low-latency C# system with MVVM architecture and API-driven workflows

I’m particularly interested in roles where I can work on real production systems, learn from experienced engineers, and grow into building large-scale, reliable platforms.
